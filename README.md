// TODO: 
// 1. make the nav sticky so it's visible all the time. 
// 2. make the form functional with an email service. 
//     https://formspree.io/
//     https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/building-a-contact-form/
// 3. the services/specialties images need to be hoverable/clickable
//     - when clicked/hovered, a darker transparent color slides "up", with a descriptive text of the item. 
//     - OR when hovered or clicked, the card "flips over" and reveals more info. 
// 4. create links to EMDR about, and Neurofeedback about. 
//     - OR create some pages with quoted texts from each of these services? 
// 5. LISTEN TO DREW'S FEEDBACK:
//   a) switch out the testimonial fake text with real ones once he gets them. 
//   b) logo needs to be more classy
//   c) specialties must also include: teenagers, anxiety, trauma, self esteem, conflict resolution. 
//   d) remove FB photos. only keep the Telos one (see if there's a better quality photo)
